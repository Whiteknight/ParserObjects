# Internal Namespace

Classes, methods and sub-namespaces inside the `Internal` namespace are provided for public use. You are allowed to use these building blocks to compose your own solutions to problems as you see fit.

**HOWEVER PLEASE NOTE**: Items in the `Internal` namespace are *explicitly not supported*. These classes and methods may change form or function or may disappear entirely between minor releases and *will not be considered a breaking change*. If you make use of these things and find value in them, please contact the ParserObjects development team to see about adding them to the supported portion of the library on a permanent basis.
