# ParserObjects

ParserObjects is a small library to help with common parsing tasks. This library includes some pre-made parser objects and parser combinators, though the abstractions it provides are arguably the most useful thing.

This library is very early pre-release for design and testing purposes. Performance is abysmal, features are missing, and none of the code here is to be trusted.
