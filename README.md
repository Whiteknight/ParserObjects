# ParserObjects

ParserObjects is a library for object-based parsers and combinators. Complex parsers can be built by constructing a graph of smaller, simple parser objects.

## Current Status

ParserObjects library is currently in active development. Abstractions and core classes are stable, and new features are being added in response to downstream need.
