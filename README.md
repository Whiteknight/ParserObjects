# ParserObjects

ParserObjects is a small library to help with common parsing tasks. This library includes some pre-made parser objects and parser combinators, though the abstractions it provides are arguably the most useful thing.

This library is very early pre-release for testing purposes. Most of the code at this point has been copied over from other projects and has a long way to go before a 1.0 "stable" release.
